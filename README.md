backend code challenge

I created a simple console interface where you an enter the five digit zipcode boundaries and an algorithm that will set the boundaries according too what zipcodes were entered. The Java program was all performed in one main method and can be executed within its own directory. 

Testing cases are also provided in the test1.java file also provided within the same package (codingProject).

To execute the program,go to codingchallenge1.java and execute it. To run unit tests, execute test1.java in your Junit IDE.
